          Zikre Sematat is a quiet, respectful space for remembering Ethiopians
          who lost their lives to ISIS. It preserves their names with dignity
          and invites reflection rather than spectacle.

          This memorial is non-graphic, non-political, and centered on honoring
          the deceased and supporting the communities that mourn them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-300">
          Our goal is to keep these stories available for future generations and
          to encourage a culture of remembrance grounded in compassion.
